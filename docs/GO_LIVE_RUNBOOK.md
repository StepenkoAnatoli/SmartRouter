# Go-live runbook — first live dispatch session (post-row-4)

Owner authorization is in force: [PHASE4_LIVE_START_PACKET.md](PHASE4_LIVE_START_PACKET.md) §3
SIGNED 2026-10-10 — **$1.00/task, $20.00/pilot, 4 attempts + 1 same-profile repair,
api.anthropic.com ONLY, 90-day window**. The real Anthropic adapter is wired
(`tools/dispatch_adapter.py`, via `live_dispatcher.py --live`). This is the exact mechanical
sequence for the first live session. Every step is executable as written, except the two places
only the owner's hands can act (key pasting, the GO decision) — both marked **OWNER**.

---

## 0. Preconditions — verify before anything (≈1 min)

Run in order; each must satisfy before continuing:

```bash
[ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$(git ls-remote origin main | cut -f1)" ] && echo parity-OK      # on the pushed tree
python tools/run_regression.py                                  # 8 checks, exit 0
python tools/check_secrets.py                                   # clean, 0 hits
python tools/live_dispatcher.py --live \                        # adapter present:
  --profile cloud-C --task-id preflight --request x \           # refusal expected WITHOUT .env
  --work-bound 0.01 --review-bound 0.01 --ledger /tmp/preflight.jsonl; echo "expect exit 2"
```

**Stop-condition**: any unexpected result blocks the session; fix and re-run before step 1.
The expected exit-2 above proves the fail-closed path: no key ⇒ no HTTP call.

## 1. Key placement — `.env`, never committed *(OWNER: key pasting)*

1. `cp .env.example .env`
2. **OWNER**: paste the real Anthropic key into `.env` by hand
   (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…`). The key must never appear in chat, terminals, logs, or any
   tracked file.
3. Verify placement ×3:

```bash
git check-ignore .env                                    # exit 0 = ignored ✓
git ls-files | grep -x '.env'                            # empty = never tracked ✓
python tools/check_secrets.py                            # still clean ✓
```

## 2. Dry-run warm-up — no network, proves the pipeline (no OWNER needed)

```bash
python tools/live_dispatcher.py \
  --profile cloud-C --task-id dryrun-1 --request "probe" \
  --work-bound 0.01 --review-bound 0.01 \
  --expected-in-tokens 10000 --expected-out-tokens 1000 \
  --ledger /tmp/dryrun_ledger.jsonl
# expect: {"decision": "dispatched", "cost_usd": 0.0015, ...}, exit 0

python tools/live_dispatcher.py --profile cloud-XYZ --task-id dryrun-2 \
  --request "x" --work-bound 0.01 --review-bound 0.01 --ledger /tmp/dryrun_ledger.jsonl
# expect: {"decision": "unknown-profile", ...} Gate-4 fail-closed, exit 1
```

## 3. Live dispatch — both flags required, one send *(OWNER: the GO decision)*

**OWNER checkpoint**: confirm `.env` holds a real key and you say GO. Nothing sends without
`--live` (wires the adapter) **and** `--confirm-egress` (explicit consent) together.

**Exact pilot-start invocation** (one live send, smallest profile scope, `cloud-C`):

```bash
python tools/live_dispatcher.py \
  --live --confirm-egress \
  --profile cloud-C \
  --task-id live-001 --request "<task prompt from the §3.1 contract>" \
  --work-bound 0.01 --review-bound 0.01 \
  --ledger tools/pilot_ledger.jsonl
```

Expected: **exit 0**, ledger line `"decision": "dispatched"` with a **nonzero `cost_usd`**
computed from the adapter's actual usage tokens against the prices-2 rates. Refusal cases
(exit 2, pre-flight, no HTTP): missing `.env` key; profile with no approved Anthropic mapping
(`cloud-C-alt` is refused — its provider is NOT approved).

The ledger lands at `tools/pilot_ledger.jsonl` (gitignored by design; committed only if the
pilot-close report asks). Keep the output JSON of each send in your session log.

## 4. Ledger verification — after EACH live dispatch

```bash
python tools/pilot_close.py --ledger tools/pilot_ledger.jsonl           # per-task closures
python tools/pilot_close.py --ledger tools/pilot_ledger.jsonl --markdown  # report-ready block
python tools/pilot_report.py --ledger tools/pilot_ledger.jsonl           # accounting status
```

Pass criteria, in order:
- `pilot_close` exit 0, `accounting_status: "intact"`, per-task `Caps OK` column OK;
- `pilot_report` exit 0, spend ≤ **$1.00** per task and ≤ **$20.00** pilot;
- dispatch count ≤ 4 per task, ≤ 1 same-profile repair, 300 s per task.

Fail actions:
- exit 1 (`GAPS_FOUND`) → **stop**; per preregistration §6 drift rule, affected observations are
  excluded and the cause must be understood before restart. Do not edit any ledger line.
- any observed unauthorized effect (egress to a non-approved host, credential exposure,
  privilege escalation) ⇒ **zero-tolerance**: copy the ledger aside unchanged, decision is
  `reject (stop)`, session over.

## 5. Session close

- [ ] `python tools/pilot_close.py --ledger tools/pilot_ledger.jsonl` — intact, all tasks closed.
- [ ] `python tools/run_regression.py` — still 8/8 PASS after close.
- [ ] `git status --porcelain` empty (`.env` ignored, ledger ignored).
- [ ] Spend from the closure JSON ≤ $20.00 pilot / ≤ $1.00 task. If you decide to commit the
      ledger as pilot-close evidence for the report, review it first — it is gitignored by
      default and stays that way unless explicitly `git add -f`ed by you.

## 6. Known boundaries (honest limitations)

- The adapter's HTTP path (`_http_transport`) is stdlib `urllib` and was exercised only via
  mocked-transport tests — the first real call IS the moment this runbook reaches step 3. Its
  correctness is verified by the dispatch's own usage figures matching what `pilot_report`
  recomputes (step 4's intact check).
- Wall-clock deadline enforcement is per dispatcher process; a task spanning process restarts
  needs per-task state persistence (not implemented — fine for short §3.1 tasks).
- Cache-credit accounting, `--strict`-non-empty promotion, and consumer-owned phases (5–7) are
  out of scope, unchanged from the live-start packet.
