# P02 reviewer designation — fresh agent session named 2026-10-10

> Per [P02_REVIEW_BRIEF.md §3](P02_REVIEW_BRIEF.md) candidate table, row 1 ("A fresh Claude Code /
> Freebuff agent instance, run read-only in a scratch clone"). This record names the reviewer for
> the §6.1 walkthrough countersignature in [P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md](P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md) and sets
> the exact procedure the reviewer must follow. The designation itself does NOT close R-D1; only
> the countersigned walkthrough does.

## 1. Designation

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Named reviewer | **A fresh agent session** — a new Claude Code / Freebuff agent instance, opened by the owner in a scratch clone of this repo, distinct from the session that authored the reviewed delta (`6d20b04 → 2f4b141` walkthrough) and from any session running in this workspace. |
| Reviewer candidate row | Brief §3 table, row 1. |
| Independence basis | The designated instance has **no authorship history** with the reviewed delta; it runs read-only in a scratch clone (no merge/push authority needed for review). This is the plan-P02 independence the prior record could not supply. |
| Designated by | Owner, 2026-10-10 (tool-assisted session, owner-directed). |
| What they review | The §6.1 walkthrough items in [P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md](P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md) — nine items — and the standing evidence table in [PHASE3_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md §1](PHASE3_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md). |
| Scope | Read-only + walkthrough countersignature. Explicitly **not** in scope: live-model dispatch, merge/push actions on the mainline, or amendment of any Phase 3 artefacts. |

## 2. Exact walkthrough the reviewer must re-derive (paste into a fresh terminal at repo root)

| # | Command | Expected observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `git diff --name-only 6d20b04..2f4b141 -- skills/ \| wc -l` | `0` |
| 2 | `python tests/smart_router_decisions.py` | exit 0; "79/79 assertions passed; 52/52 distinct fixture IDs" |
| 3 | `python tools/validate_skills.py` then `python tools/validate_skills.py --strict` | exit 0 both |
| 4 | `python fixture_checks.py` | exit 0; "All arithmetic fixtures verified." |
| 5 | inline SHA-256 of `d7c00f96a17c35e6c47c5ba1f7e3a9160c966042\|<label>` for all six seed labels | 6/6 hex values match the §3.2 table in `docs/PHASE3_PREREGISTRATION.md` |
| 6 | `git diff --numstat 6d20b04..2f4b141 -- docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` | `2  2`, `recieve`→`receive` only |
| 7 | credential-shaped grep across the 9 delta files | 0 hits |
| 8 | per-value threshold comparison `6d20b04` vs `2f4b141` | all §4/§5 values numerically unchanged |
| 9 | read merge-authority note in [PROJECT_COMPLETION.md §3](PROJECT_COMPLETION.md) | confirms no independent-reviewer acceptance existed at merge time (the R-D1 gap as originally disclosed) |

All nine are also recorded with observed values in [PHASE3_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md §2](PHASE3_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md);
the fresh session should re-derive them independently, not copy.

## 3. Countersignature procedure (brief §4 step 2)

1. The fresh reviewer session runs the nine commands above in its own clone and records observed
   outputs in its own words.
2. It edits [P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md](P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md) §5's "Independent countersignature" row:
   fills in reviewer identity ("fresh agent session, <session id or date>"), date, and a short
   attest line naming the items it re-derived and any discrepancy found.
3. It commits that countersignature as its own commit (author identity distinct from this
   workspace's session), which is what physically proves the non-author review step.
4. The owner then records Phase 3 formal exit in [PROJECT_COMPLETION.md](PROJECT_COMPLETION.md)
   referencing that countersignature commit hash.

## 4. What this designation does and does not do

- **Does**: commit the repo to a named reviewer identity per the brief; publish the exact
  checklist; prepare §5 of the review record to receive the countersignature.
- **Does not**: close R-D1, declare Phase 3 formally exited, or substitute for the fresh session's
  own observations. Those remain gated on the countersignature commit itself.

## 5. Status

| Step | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Reviewer named per brief §3 row 1 | **DONE 2026-10-10** (this record) |
| Fresh session opened + walkthrough executed + §5 countersigned | **PENDING** — the owner opens the separate session |
| Phase 3 formal exit recorded in PROJECT_COMPLETION.md | **PENDING** — after the countersignature commit |
