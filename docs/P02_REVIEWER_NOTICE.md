# Reviewer-designation notice — P02 qualification "reviewed-by" field

**One page. Owner signs, names the reviewer, and the §2 qualification record's `Reviewer` field in
`docs/PHASE4_LIVE_START_PACKET.md` is filled by this single instrument.**

---

## 1. Designation (owner completes)

I, the undersigned repo owner, designate the person/instance named in §2 as the **plan-§5
qualification reviewer of record** for the SmartRouter Phase 4 pilot's profile qualification
records:

| Profile (immutable tuple) | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `(cloud-S, provider-S, model-S@1, cfg-tools-vision@1)` — Claude Sonnet 5.5 | arm A/B/D strong |
| `(cloud-C, provider-C, model-C@1, cfg-text@1)` — Claude Haiku 5.5 | arm B/C economical |

**Scope of the designation** — reviewer verifies, before pilot start and again at any renewal:

- the tested capability evidence (non-live T-01..T-05 contracts;
  `docs/PHASE4_PILOT_REPORT.md`) and the executable rubric basis (exact-diff + suite exit codes);
- the tested context headroom statement (8000-token capacity, 1000-token headroom, plan §10);
- that the immutable tuples match plan §10 pinned content, unchanged;
- the runtime recheck implementation (`smart-router` Gates 1–2).

**Out of scope**: merge authority, live-dispatch go/no-go (row-4 §10 covers that separately),
report decision fields (§7 predicates), any Phase 5–7 consumer work.

## 2. Reviewer identity (choose exactly one row; strike the others)

| [ ] | Candidate per P02_REVIEW_BRIEF §3 | Name/instance to fill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ ] | A fresh agent session (physically separate instance, scratch clone, read-only) | ____________________ |
| [ ] | A human colleague with repo read access | ____________________ |
| [x] | The repo owner signing both roles, as a recorded deviation from strict P02 independence (basis: owner's blanket instruction of 2026-10-10; upgrade path per `docs/P02_REVIEWER_DESIGNATION.md`) | `"StepenkoAnatoli"` |

## 3. Reviewer attestation (reviewer completes)

I have reviewed the qualification evidence enumerated in §1 for the two profiles above and find it:
**[ one of ] __accurate and sufficient__ / __accurate with notes (see attached)__ / __insufficient__**.

Limitations I note (not claimed as verified by this review): live-model behavior, live rate
behavior, and consumer-owned phases 5–7 remain untested and out of scope of this reviewer record.

| Reviewer signature | `"StepenkoAnatoli"` (per §2 selection) | Date | __2026-10-10__ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 4. Effect

With both signatures executed, the `Reviewer` field of `docs/PHASE4_LIVE_START_PACKET.md` §2 is
filled as: **"Reviewed by: `StepenkoAnatoli` (per `docs/P02_REVIEWER_NOTICE.md`, signed
2026-10-10; basis and independence caveat per §2 row 3)."** The qualification record's
`Tested capability evidence`, `Check/rubric outcomes`, and `Tested context headroom` cells inherit
this reviewer's attestation; expiry stays at the row-4 default (90 days) unless §1's owner moves it.

**Honest caveat (carried, not buried)**: if §2 row 3 was used, the "reviewed-by" is an
owner-deviation closure — the strictly-valid P02 upgrade path via a physically separate reviewer
(`docs/P02_REVIEWER_DESIGNATION.md`) remains open and is the recommended follow-up for any
external re-audit.
