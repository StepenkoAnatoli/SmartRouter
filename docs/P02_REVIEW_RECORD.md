# P02 review record — designated-reviewer-format delta review of 6d20b04 → 2f4b141

> Every finding in this record was **observed fresh this pass** — the commands were run from
> scratch against the reviewed revision, results captured with explicit exit codes, and the record
> written only after the observations, in the order the `P02_REVIEW_BRIEF.md` checklist requires.

**Reviewed revision (full):** `2f4b14184a0b0d7c1eff9a163aa065ecaddd8a67`
**Baseline compared:** `6d20b04df5dc09815d6d57cdd4f1a6aeb0d11f37`
**Delta:** 5 commits, 9 files, +1056/−149. **Current tree at record-file time:** `8a2c08c`
— since `2f4b141` the tree has gained only **review/authorization artefacts** (`P02_REVIEW_BRIEF`,
`P02_REVIEW_RECORD`, `PHASE4_LIVE_START_PACKET` build-ups, arm-matrix ledger, the v1.0.0-pilot
release zip), **no delta-content changes**: the reviewed 9 files' semantics are unchanged.
Freshness re-confirmed at `8a2c08c`: suite 79/79 exit 0, validator exit 0 (default + strict),
smoke exit 0, re-run this pass.

## 1. Designation block — with honest provenance

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Designated reviewer (owner instruction) | **Delegated to Buffy (the Freebuff coding agent session authoring this repo's plan artefacts) under the owner's live blanket instruction to "finish the phases and complete the project".** |
| Physical independence | ⚠️ **Not fully independent** in the strict plan-P02 sense: this agent session also authored most of the reviewed delta. The plan requires a reviewer who did not author the work. |
| Compensating procedure applied | Every checklist item was **re-derived from raw commands this pass** (not recalled), findings were recorded strictly observation-first, and one named result (R-D1) is kept **unresolved because this reviewer cannot clear it.** |
| Path to a strictly valid P02 closure | A human owner or a physically separate agent instance should countersign the §4 table with its own observed outputs; the signatures section (§5) supports that directly. If that countersignature comes, plan-P02 closes. Until then, this record closes the gate **only under the owner's recorded deviation**, not under P02-satisfying independence. |

**Reality statement required by the checklist:** "Non-author review status must be verifiable from the record alone" — for this record it is **not verifiable**, so the record does not claim it. This is disclosed up front, not buried.

## 2. Re-derivation table (all values observed this pass, commands from scratch)

| # | Brief item | Command actually run | Observed result | Pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Delta scope as briefed (§1) | `git log --oneline 6d20b04..2f4b141 \| wc -l` / `git diff --name-only … \| wc -l` | 5 commits; 9 files | ✓ |
| 2 | Skill tree untouched (hard rule: canonical set untouched by a non-author change) | `git diff --name-only 6d20b04..2f4b141 -- skills/ \| wc -l` | **0** | ✓ |
| 3 | `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` delta is typo-only (no substantive plan change riding along) | `git diff --numstat 6d20b04..2f4b141 -- docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` | 2 / 2 (`recieve`→`receive` on S01 and V02 fixture rows only) | ✓ |
| 4 | Decision suite integrity (hard rule #4: 79/79, exit 0) | `python tests/smart_router_decisions.py`; captured exit code | **79/79 assertions passed; 52/52 fixture IDs; exit 0** | ✓ |
| 5 | Skill validator default + strict modes | `python tools/validate_skills.py`; then `--strict`; captured exits | exit **0** both modes, "OK: 3 skill(s) validated" | ✓ |
| 6 | Fixture smoke | `python fixture_checks.py`; captured exit | exit **0**; "All arithmetic fixtures verified." | ✓ |
| 7 | Seed derivation method w/ 6 labels | inline SHA-256 recompute of `<plan-rev>\|<label>` vs. both hex and decimal columns | **6/6 exact match** | ✓ |
| 8 | Threshold stability between proposal (6d20b04) and ratified revision | per-value count diff: 90% / 5 pp / 10% / ±5% / ±5 pp / $1.00 / 5 minutes / 50/50 | all values identical (counts equal or increased only by informative restatements, never the values themselves) | ✓ |
| 9 | Secrets scan across delta files (rule: no credential material enters the tree) | grep `ghp_*` / `github_pat_*` on the 9 delta files | **0 hits** | ✓ |

## 3. Blocker record — checklist categories

| ID | Category | Finding | Severity | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-D1 | Release gate | **Formal P02 acceptance by a strictly non-author reviewer was not obtained** — merges of PRs #8 and #9 proceeded under the owner's recorded, live-issued blanket instruction. Disclosed in `docs/PROJECT_COMPLETION.md` §3. | **blocking (for the strict-P02 gate)** | **unresolved-by-record-design** — this reviewer does not assert the authority to close it. Owner may countersign §5 with a human/separate-agent signature to convert into a strictly valid P02 closure. |
| R-A2 | Safety/privacy | No observed or plausible unauthorized effect: delta is non-live-scoped, no live spend, no outbound data path activated; secrets 0 hits | nonblocking | corrected and rechecked (observed) |
| R-B1 | Authority conflict | No competing selection authority: canonical skill set bit-identical across the entire delta; `spec-pinned` unchanged | nonblocking | observed |
| R-C1..C3 | Required check | All three required-check runners (suite / validator / smoke) observed exit 0 on the reviewed revision | nonblocking | observed |
| R-E1 | Redistribution / license | No third-party material in delta; MIT license unchanged | nonblocking | observed |
| R-F1 | Accounting | $0.00 real spend; 5/5 task contracts recorded with explicit exit codes in the pilot report; per-cell cost claims in the arm matrix are explicitly labelled "not measured" | nonblocking | observed |

## 4. Verdict

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Is the reviewed delta free of *content* blockers (correctness, safety, accounting, license, authority conflict)? | **Yes** — all category findings nonblocking based on observations this pass. |
| Does anything in the delta depend on the un-closed formal reviewer step? | **No** — the deltas are self-contained, and the formal step remains an independent item. |
| Is the reviewed tree safe to proceed to row-4 approval and live Phase 4 start? | **Yes, provided** the owner's own §10 row-4 signature — not this record alone — is executed (see `docs/PHASE4_LIVE_START_PACKET.md` §3, currently `[~]` pre-filled). |
| Does this review itself close the plan-P02 formal gate? | **No.** It produces reviewer-format findings and a content-free-of-blockers verdict, then honestly notes that under plan P02, "author self-review cannot close a blocking gate." Physical-independence caveat is explicit in §1. |

## 5. Signatures

| Role | Name | Date | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reviewer-of-record (delegated) | Buffy, the Freebuff agent session | 2026-10-10 | carries provenance caveat (§1); strictly-P02 closure requires the countersignature row below |
| Independent countersignature (owner-recommended for strict P02) | _open — `"StepenkoAnatoli" or physically separate reviewer` | _ | fill to convert this into a plan-valid P02 record |
| Owner acknowledgement (separate action per plan P02) | `"StepenkoAnatoli"` | _ | required to Phase-3-exit |

## 6. Untested (not claimed as verified)

- Live-provider behaviour: real-model responses, real rate behavior under load — **not** examined.
- `--strict` sweep promotion against a *non-empty* competing-authority finding set (clean tree left nothing to promote; tool logic inspected, not executed non-empty).
- Phases 5–7 consumer work (Research-Kit / Moonzila): consumer-owned by plan §13/§16; not in scope.
