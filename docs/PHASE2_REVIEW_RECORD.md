# Phase 2 author-side review record (skill preview)

Branch: `skills/smart-router-v1`, based on main at merge commit
`d7c00f96a17c35e6c47c5ba1f7e3a9160c966042`. Prepared by the plan author (Buffy). **This is author
validation only; it is not an independent review, is not an approval, and does not close Phase 2.**
Per plan sections 14/15, Phase 2 exit requires independently reviewed semantic coverage of the full
revision plus owner acknowledgement — which remains outstanding.

## Delivered in this branch

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [skills/smart-router/SKILL.md](SKILL.md) | Canonical routing authority: ordered gates, output contract |
| [skills/smart-router/references/gates.md](references/gates.md) | Normative gate contract |
| [skills/smart-router/references/brief-and-result.md](references/brief-and-result.md) | Compact brief/result workflow |
| [skills/smart-router-review/SKILL.md](../smart-router-review/SKILL.md) | Blocker-review procedure; never selects |
| [skills/smart-router-review/references/blocked-review.md](../smart-router-review/references/blocked-review.md) | Blocker checklist/evidence record |
| [skills/smart-router-eval-prep/SKILL.md](../smart-router-eval-prep/SKILL.md) | Preregistration preparation; never authorizes trials |
| [skills/smart-router-eval-prep/references/preregistration.md](../smart-router-eval-prep/references/preregistration.md) | Preregistration checklist |
| [tools/validate_skills.py](../tools/validate_skills.py) | Packaging validator |
| [README.md](../README.md) | Canonical-authority pointer; historical docs preserved |

## Author validation performed

| Check | Scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontmatter per agentskills.io spec | all 3 SKILL.md | name lowercase/hyphen/directory-matched; description present and ≤1024 chars; license/metadata valid; no compatibility/allowed-tools constraints triggered |
| SKILL.md body ≤500 lines | all 3 | 97 / 61 / 56 lines |
| Reference resolution one-level-deep | all SKILL.md + references | 0 broken links (validator catches this class) |
| Related-name sweep for competing authority | README/docs/LICENSE + validator | no operational tier/flowchart/header/score-approval rules outside `skills/`; historical README content explicitly linked as non-operational (F4/S14) |
| Secret-pattern scan | full tree | 0 hits |
| Cross-references between skills | sibling pointers | `defers-to: smart-router` present in both non-canonical SKILL.md; canonical skill does not defer |
| Pinned spec revision stated | all skills | `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md@d7c00f9` in frontmatter metadata |
| **Packaging validator** | all skills | `python tools/validate_skills.py` → `OK: 3 skill(s) validated` (exit 0) |

## Compliance notes (per plan section 14 Phase 2 exit gate)

- Single-authority migration: canonical skill is the only routing rule-set; review/eval-prep skills
  explicitly defer and are not selectors. The README **does not** restate operational tiers,
  flowcharts, response headers or score approvals.
- Boundary: these skills are recommendations/procedures, not runtime enforcement. Hosts own actual
  authorization, dispatch, privacy and billing. Not stated anywhere as able to spend or transmit on
  their own.
- No installer, no release changelog, no product code beyond the validator (itself a doc-checking
  utility, not part of the skills).
- Consumer adoption, runtime no-send/effect tests, and paid pilot claims remain **out of scope**
  for this branch and are still blockers for later phases.

## Outstanding (not claimable satisfied here)

- [ ] Independent non-author review of this branch's full revision (semantic + packaging rechecked).
- [ ] Owner acknowledgement after that review, at the reviewed full commit hash.
- [ ] Any amendment alongside these skills requires reaffirmation before Phase 2 closes.
- [ ] Consumer adoption/deactivation of legacy policy copies (none exist here yet) still required for
      consumers *outside* this repo.

## Limits

Validation was run locally on this branch's bytes only. No runtime execution, no host integration,
no model calls, no billing observation was performed. Nothing in this record authorizes consuming
these skills or migrating any consumer host — that remains a separately authorized step per the plan.
