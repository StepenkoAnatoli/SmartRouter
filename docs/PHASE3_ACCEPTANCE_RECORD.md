# Phase 3 acceptance record — designated-reviewer pass, 2026-10-10

> Companion to [P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md](P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md) (the earlier delta review of
> `6d20b04 → 2f4b141`). This record is the **acceptance pass**: it cites the standing audit
> evidence lines, re-derives every marked **[RECHECK]** item from fresh commands run this pass, and
> applies the §4/§5 closure mechanics of the P02 brief to the current tree.

**Accepted revision (full):** `81edfa71450ef904690437ea172e6e64d9d59e61`
**Baseline of the originally reviewed delta:** `6d20b04df5dc09815d6d57cdd4f1a6aeb0d11f37`
**Head of that delta (unchanged):** `2f4b14184a0b0d7c1eff9a163aa065ecaddd8a67`

## 1. Standing audit evidence (cited lines, not re-derived here)

| Evidence item | Where | What it establishes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R-D1 origin** | [PROJECT_COMPLETION.md §3](PROJECT_COMPLETION.md) — "That step was **superseded by explicit owner instruction this turn**… Both merges were made directly by the named owner's agent with `merge_method=merge`" plus the PR#8→`09fd8de`, PR#9→`c69352c` table | The formal independent-reviewer step was not used for PRs #8/#9; the owner directed the merges. This is the honest bookkeeping R-D1 discloses — `unresolved-by-record-design` until a countersignature authenticates the review step. |
| **R-D1 rule** | [blocked-review.md L32-33](../skills/smart-router-review/references/blocked-review.md): "author self-review cannot close a blocking gate that requires independence (plan P01/P02)." | Why the earlier record left R-D1 open and why this acceptance pass can close it only against the owner's recorded deviation, not by re-asserting authority the reviewing session doesn't have. |
| **PR merge SHAs** | `git log 6d20b04..2f4b141`: `09fd8de Merge PR #8`, `c69352c Merge PR #9` | Two substantive preregistration revisions merged; each names its scope in the subject line. |
| **Auth status column discipline** | [PHASE3_PREREGISTRATION.md](PHASE3_PREREGISTRATION.md) §4/§5/§10/§11 — per-item RATIFIED/PENDING/PROPOSED labels retained through the merged chain | Brief item §2.2 (every substantive amendment carries an explicit status label). Verified unchanged in RECHECK #8 below. |

## 2. [RECHECK] re-derivation table — every command run fresh this pass

All values below were observed 2026-10-10 on the current tree (`81edfa7`); exit codes are captured,
not filtered. Items map to the earlier record's §2 table exactly.

| # | Item | Command | Observed this pass | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Delta scope | `git log --oneline 6d20b04..2f4b141 \| wc -l`; `git diff --name-only 6d20b04..2f4b141 \| wc -l` | 5 commits; 9 files — identical to the earlier record's numbers | ✓ matches |
| 2 | Skill tree untouched | `git diff --name-only 6d20b04..2f4b141 -- skills/ \| wc -l` | **0** | ✓ matches |
| 3 | Plan delta typo-only | `git diff --numstat 6d20b04..2f4b141 -- docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` | `2  2` (the `recieve`→`receive` rows only) | ✓ matches |
| 4 | Decision suite integrity | `python tests/smart_router_decisions.py` | **79/79 assertions; 52/52 fixture IDs; exit 0** | ✓ matches |
| 5 | Validator default + strict | `python tools/validate_skills.py`; `python tools/validate_skills.py --strict` | **exit 0 both modes** | ✓ matches |
| 6 | Fixture smoke | `python fixture_checks.py` | **"All arithmetic fixtures verified."; exit 0** | ✓ matches |
| 7 | Seed derivation — full 6/6 | inline SHA-256 of `d7c00f96…|<label>` for all six labels compared to the preregistration table hex values | **6/6 exact hex matches** (holdout 1–3, ordering 1–3) | ✓ matches; strengthened from 1 spot-check to all 6 |
| 8 | Threshold stability | grep counts per value: `90%` 1→1, `5 pp` 2→2, `10%` 3→3, `±5%` 1→1, `$1.00` 1→2, `5 minutes` 1→1, `50/50` 1→1 across `6d20b04 → 2f4b141` of `docs/PHASE3_PREREGISTRATION.md` | All values numerically unchanged. The one count increase ($1.00, 1→2) was spot-verified: the new occurrence is an *informative restatement* explaining conservative bounds before a price list exists — the threshold value itself is quoted identically in both revisions | ✓ matches |
| 8b | Status-label upgrade discipline | `git show 6d20b04:docs/PHASE3_PREREGISTRATION.md` vs `git show 2f4b141:…` on the `$1.00` row | **PROPOSED → RATIFIED (owner, 2026-10-10)** — the label change tracks a recorded owner action, exactly the §2.2 brief requirement | ✓ observed |
| 9 | Secrets scan | `git grep -nE 'sk-ant-…\|ghp_…\|github_pat_…' 2f4b141` — exit 1 (no hits); `python tools/check_secrets.py` on the current tree — **clean, 0 hits, exit 0** | ✓ matches |

Additional coverage this pass (outside the originally reviewed delta, in the same gate):
`python tools/run_regression.py` — validator + dispatcher suite (26 checks) + pilot-report suite
(10 tests) + secrets scan — **all PASS, exit 0** on `81edfa7`.

## 3. Blocker dispositions at acceptance time

| ID | Earlier disposition | This pass |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R-D1 | unresolved-by-record-design | **Cleared-by-acceptance-mechanics (see §4)** — the review substance is complete (all 9 items ✓ above), the R-D1 evidence trail is cited in §1, and the owner's recorded deviation in PROJECT_COMPLETION.md §3 is confirmed accurate by this pass. R-D1 converts from "blocking" to "closed under the owner's recorded deviation" when the owner signs §4 of this record; the record itself does not claim more than that. |
| R-A2/R-B1/R-C1..C3/R-E1/R-F1 | nonblocking (observed) | All confirmed unchanged — no new findings this pass; the current tree adds tooling and authorization artefacts that do not touch the reviewed 9-file delta (verified in RECHECK #1–#2 matching). |

## 4. Acceptance + owner acknowledgement (per P02 brief §4 mechanics)

| Role | Name | Date | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Designated reviewer (delegated-to-agency, per P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md §1 caveat, unchanged) | Buffy (Freebuff agent session) | 2026-10-10 | Review substance complete; all [RECHECK] items re-derived fresh; this acceptance record filed. |
| Owner acknowledgement — Phase 3 document gate closes at `81edfa7` | `"StepenkoAnatoli"` | _ | **Required**: one commit or PR-comment acknowledgment on this record closes the Phase 3 document gate per the brief §4 step 2. Without it, this record remains an acceptance-ready artifact, not a closed gate. |

## 5. Untested / not claimed (unchanged scope)

- Live-provider behavior, live rate behavior, and all consumer-owned phases (5–7) remain out of
  scope and untested — identical to the earlier record's §6.
- The seed *decimal* columns were checked as hex here; decimal expansions were not recomputed this
  pass (the hex is the canonical derived value; the earlier record's method check remains the
  authority for the decimal digits).
