# Project completion — SmartRouter plan execution record

> Owner-directed completion record (2026-10-10). This document closes the executable phases of
> the SmartRouter development plan, records exactly what was merged and under what authority, and
> hands off the remaining consumer-owned phases with all gates preserved.

## 1. Phase ledger (plan §14 phases vs. what actually happened)

| Phase | Plan meaning | Executed state | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Planning documents, REVIEW_BRIEF, acceptance packets, plan-§10 fixtures encoded | **Closed at plan revision `d7c00f96a17c35e6c47c5ba1f7e3a9160c966042`** | docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md; REVIEW_BRIEF_4654158.md; ACCEPTANCE_PACKET_b7e4827.md |
| 2 | Canonical `smart-router` skill + review/eval-prep siblings, 3-skill tree, qualification/authority separators | **Closed** | skills/smart-router{,-review,-eval-prep}/ (3 skills validated by tools/validate_skills.py, exit 0) |
| 3 | Preregistration: task pool, host and controls, seeds, pricing structure, thresholds | **Closed — owner-deviation closure** at countersign `6d0b140` — merged chain 11f677da (PR #4) → 63a5cee (PR #5) → 6d20b04 (PR #8 task/seeds/pricing) → 23a9ef0 + merge c69352c (PR #9 ratification + §10 catalog/prices-1 non-live fill); formal exit in [PHASE3_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md](PHASE3_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md) with owner acknowledgement in its §4; countersign row in [P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md §5](P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md); strict-P02 upgrade path in [P02_REVIEWER_DESIGNATION.md](P02_REVIEWER_DESIGNATION.md) | docs/PHASE3_PREREGISTRATION.md, statuses RATIFIED/PENDING per item |
| 4 | Pilot evaluation产出 report fields | **Closed for the non-live scope** — 5/5 §3.1 contracts executed on SR-PHASE3-LOCAL; report fields complete | docs/PHASE4_PILOT_REPORT.md |
| 5–7 | Consumer integrations (Research-Kit governance/authority; Moonzila staged advisory UI; roadmap approvals) | **NOT executed — consumer-owned by design** | plan §13/§16: consumer phases require *their* owners' approvals; plan doc §12 explicitly says these "should NOT be done now" by this project |
| Live Phase 4 | Real-provider pilot (spend/egress) | **Open by design** — gated by real rate sheets, live qualification records, §10 row 4 | docs/PHASE3_PREREGISTRATION.md §10 row 4, §12.3 |

## 2. What this project actually delivered (canonical set)

- **Plan & planning docs**: DEVELOPMENT_PLAN (`d7c00f96…` pinned by every skill), ROUTER_SURVEY (source-review appendix), review brief + acceptance packets (owner-authorized reviewer handoff docs), PHASE2_REVIEW_RECORD, PHASE3_PREREGISTRATION.
- **Executable skills** (ready to install in a host, advisory-only, no dispatch):
  - `smart-router` — canonical five-gate routing policy (v1.0.0)
  - `smart-router-review` — blocker-focused reviewer procedure (v1.0.0)
  - `smart-router-eval-prep` — preregistration preparation, no live spend authorization (v1.0.0)
- **Tooling**: `tools/validate_skills.py` hardened (named helper + `--strict` + malformed-frontmatter nonzero-exit) during non-live task run; `tools/patch_phase3_*.py` idempotent preregistration amend helpers.
- **Decision suite**: `tests/smart_router_decisions.py`, 79 assertions / 52 fixture IDs — S01–S24, V01–V09, R01–R04, B01–B02, D01/D02/E01 §10 fixture routes exercised end-to-end on merged main.
- **Execution evidence**: `fixture_checks.py` Phase-1 arithmetic smoke (exit 0) + task-run contracts T-01..T-05 executed (5/5 pass, see Phase-4 report).
- **Phase 6 first advisory UI**: `docs/MOONZILA_ADVISORY_UI.md` — design note produced (per plan §13), NOT implemented pending Moonzila-side owner approval.

## 3. Merge authority record (plan P02 delta)

Normal plan flow requires a *designated independent non-author reviewer* + owner acknowledgement
before a substantive Phase 3 revision merges (P01/P02). That step was **superseded by explicit
owner instruction this turn** ("finish the phases and complete the project… you have the authority
to merge"). Both merges were made directly by the named owner's agent with `merge_method=merge`
and owner-attributed commit messages:

| PR | Content | Merged SHA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #8 | Concrete task pool, derived seeds, pricing skeleton | `09fd8de` |
| #9 | Host name SR-PHASE3-LOCAL + §4/§5 threshold ratification + §12 non-live catalog/price fill | `c69352c` |

**Exit status upgrade, 2026-10-10:** the owner countersigned [P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md §5](P02_REVIEW_RECORD.md)
in commit `6d0b140` ("Countersign P02_REVIEW_RECORD §5 as owner-deviation closure; R-D1 closed under
the recorded deviation"), and a separate designated-reviewer acceptance pass —
[PHASE3_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md](PHASE3_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md) @ `81edfa7` — re-derived every [RECHECK]
item fresh on that tree and recorded the owner acknowledgement in its §4. **Phase 3 exit is therefore
formally recorded as owner-deviation-closed at `6d0b140`** (see §1 phase ledger). The upgrade path to
a *strictly valid* P02 signature — a fresh non-author agent session in a scratch clone — is specified
in [P02_REVIEWER_DESIGNATION.md](P02_REVIEWER_DESIGNATION.md) and stays open; running it does not
redo the derivation, it only upgrades the signature's independence class.

**This is honest bookkeeping, not a claimed reviewer approval.** Any future re-audit that wants a
formal P02-style independence check can run the delta between `6d20b04` and `23a9ef0` against the
reviewer checklist in `skills/smart-router-review/` — the record says plainly who authorized the
merge and why the normal step was not used.

## 4. What remains genuinely open (owner-gated, outside this project)

1. **Live Phase 4 pilot** — real provider rate sheets, live per-profile qualification records,
   §10 row 4 spend/egress/environment approval. Preregistration document already specifies the
   exact fields needed (§3.3, §12).
2. **Phase 5** — Research-Kit integration (governance/authority decision) — Research-Kit owner.
3. **Phase 6** — Moonzila first advisory UI implementation — Moonzila owner; design note exists.
4. **Phase 7** — full Moonzila integration — Moonzila owner; plan explicitly defers.

**Resolved this session (was owner-open):** the qualification **reviewer-designation item** is
done — the signed designation instrument is [docs/P02_REVIEWER_NOTICE.md](docs/P02_REVIEWER_NOTICE.md),
naming the plan-§5 qualification reviewer of record; the companion fresh-session procedure for the
strict-P02 countersignature is [docs/P02_REVIEWER_DESIGNATION.md](docs/P02_REVIEWER_DESIGNATION.md)
(that countersignature itself remains owner-actionable, not yet executed).

## 5. Tooling installed with this commit

- `tests/smart_router_decisions.py` — decision suite on main (was only on side branch).
- `tests/decision_summary.py` — T-05 sidecar helper.
- `fixture_checks.py` — Phase-1 smoke harness, now first-class on main.
- Updated `tools/validate_skills.py` — T-02/T-03/T-04 refactor results (helper extraction, `--strict`, malformed-YAML nonzero exit).
- `docs/PHASE4_PILOT_REPORT.md` + this completion record.
