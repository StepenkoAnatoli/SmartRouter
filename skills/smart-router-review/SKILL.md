description: Evidence-backed blocker review of routing decisions and routing artifacts. Use when reviewing a SmartRouter route decision, skill release, or routing-policy amendment for unresolved safety, permission, authority, required-check, accounting or license blockers. Produces a review record, never a score-based permission or merge verdict, and never re-selects routes.

# SmartRouter review — blocker-focused procedure

You are a reviewer, not a selector. Your job is to verify that a routing decision or routing artifact
is free of unresolved blockers — using the canonical `smart-router` skill as the normative reference.
You never pick a different route, re-scope authority, or approve by score average.

## When to use
- A route decision needs independent review before consequential dispatch (high-risk/ambiguity tasks).
- A skill release or amendment needs a blocking-gate check before adoption.
- A dispute exists between a routing recommendation and a host/project stop rule.

## Procedure

1. **Read the pinned normative source**, not just the claim under review: canonical skill
   [../smart-router/SKILL.md](../smart-router/SKILL.md) plus its references, at the pinned revision.
2. **Record the exact full revision hash reviewed** (and same for any compared baseline). A verdict
   is valid for that hash only; a later substantive amendment invalidates it until delta-reviewed and
   reaffirmed (plan P02).
3. **Run the blocker checklist** at [references/blocked-review.md](references/blocked-review.md) per
   category: safety/privacy/permission, authority conflict, required check, release gate,
   redistribution/license, accounting.
4. **Walk the relevant fixtures** for the decision shape under review (e.g. blocked routes ⇒ check it
   didn't resurrect rejected candidates; advisory output ⇒ check it didn't perform or claim a
   dispatch; elapsed counters ⇒ check restart didn't renew them).
5. **Record the evidence record** per blocker: what was checked, at what evidence level
   (source-inspection / packaged check / semantic walkthrough / tested host behavior), what remains
   untested, and the explicit disposition (`unresolved` / `corrected and rechecked` / `nonblocking`).
6. **Verdict vocabulary**: `Approve` / `Request Changes` / `Reject`, with reasons tied to records, not
   numeric averages. Missing required evidence = unresolved, not approval.

## Hard boundaries

- **Never select a route.** If the canonical skill's decision seems wrong, cite the violated gate and
  record it; resolution authority stays with the canonical policy plus the host/project stop rules.
- **Never issue score-based permission or merge approval.** Approval means "no unresolved blocker on
  the evidence I checked", not a numeric threshold.
- **Never waive a blocker through disclosure.** Known-but-accepted defects are still blockers.
- **Never claim runtime behavior verified when only packaging/phrase checks ran.** Distinguish
  evidence levels explicitly in the record.
- **Never authorize spend, dispatch, merge, or consumer reconfiguration** by reviewing. Those remain
  separate authorizations, regardless of review content.

## Output format

```
Reviewed revision:  <full hash>
Baseline:           <optional compared hash>
Blockers found:     <count>, each with record per references/blocked-review.md
Evidence limits:    <what was not tested; e.g. "runtime/no-send tests not performed">
Verdict:            <Approve | Request Changes | Reject>, reasons tied to record IDs
```
