"""Arm-coverage matrix ledger — A-D × T-01..T-05 for the non-live Phase 4 pilot.

Extends docs/PHASE4_PILOT_REPORT.md (per-task evidence ledger) with the arm
axis the preregistration §1 ratified structurally: every task must be traced
to all four arms (A strong direct, B economical direct, C simple fixed rule,
D SmartRouter skill flow). Output: a 4×5 JSON ledger (20 cells), each cell
carrying:
  * `evidence`   — the deterministic artifact observed for that arm on that task
  * `expected`   — the arm-level behavior the §3.1 contract requires
  * `match`      — observed == expected (pass) or not (fail)

Arms are executed as *simulations on the same deterministic model the decision
suite tests* (`tests/smart_router_decisions.py` RouteContext / choose_route) —
non-live, $0.00 spend, in keeping with the pilot report's scope declaration.
No live-model dispatch occurs. Per-cell costs are labels, not measurements
(the pilot report's "not measured" accounting rule for non-live scope).

Cell semantics:
  A (strong direct): task dispatches straight to the strongest qualified
      profile for its category, no gates consulted beyond qualification.
  B (economical direct): task dispatches straight to the cheapest qualified
      profile for its category.
  C (simple fixed rule): choose_route with [cheap, strong] candidates — the
      deterministic cheap-if-eligible-else-strong selector.
  D (SmartRouter): choose_route with the full candidate set (all four
      profiles), running every gate in order; records the exact route the
      gate-runner returns.
