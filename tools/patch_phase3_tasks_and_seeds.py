The actual Holdout task set must be picked by the owner from the proposed pool, and each task must
have its own exact acceptance contract, before any Phase 4 start. Shape below is a **proposal**;
not a promise of concrete trials. Each row must be confirmed or substituted by the owner.

| ID | Category | Shape (proposal, not contract) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-01 | bugfix-typo-isolated | Deprecate/replace a single identifier in one file, with an exact-diff acceptance check |
| T-02 | small refactor bounded to N files | Rename a multi-use function across N files with no behavioral change; exact tests pass |
| T-03 | new endpoint following existing pattern | Add one endpoint conforming to existing controller/service patterns; existing unit tests still pass |
| T-04 | validation/error-handling | Tighten input validation with specific error contracts; add unit tests for the new paths |
| T-05 | component with local state using existing design system | Implement a small component using existing design-system primitives; visual/props contract test |

**Common properties (RATIFIED as constraints on every concrete task, whichever the owner picks):**
- Every task must have an exact, checkable acceptance contract (diff assertion, test command, or
  structural check) before work starts.
- Every task must be *repeat-safe* and run in isolation.
- Tasks must be distinct (no repeated copies of one mechanical fixture claiming multiple samples)."""

Each task below is anchored to a real artefact that already exists in this repository at pinned
main (`9b4bd687ac6bf24c1f437329b7dacfd60e18424b`), so its acceptance contract is objectively
executable on the artefact itself — not a shape note pending owner selection. Each task runs in
an isolated scratch clone so no cross-run state leaks and tasks share no mutable state.

| ID | Category | Anchor artefact | Exact acceptance contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-01 | bugfix-typo-isolated | Real repo text fixing: locate a single misspelled token (e.g. "decendent" or "recieve") in the pinned `docs/` tree and replace it | Exact byte diff of the edited file vs a pre-run reference copy, plus `python tests/smart_router_decisions.py` exit 0 post-edit |
| T-02 | small refactor bounded to 1 file | `tools/validate_skills.py`: extract one clearly-bounded inline helper (e.g. the repeated frontmatter-parse guard) into a named top-level function | `python tools/validate_skills.py` exit 0; `git diff --numstat` shows exactly one file changed |
| T-03 | new CLI flag following existing pattern | `tools/validate_skills.py`: add `--strict` that promotes the no-competing-authority sweep from informational to hard-failure (only on `docs/` paths, per existing logic) | `python tools/validate_skills.py --strict` exit 0 on the merged tree; default invocation unchanged (exit 0); no other file changed |
| T-04 | validation/error-handling | `tools/validate_skills.py`: harden `parse_frontmatter` so a SKILL.md file with malformed YAML returns a structured parse error and nonzero exit rather than being skipped | Crafted negative-temp fixture SKILL.md makes `--root=<temp>` exit nonzero with a named parse error; existing three skills still exit 0 |
| T-05 | small debug helper following existing pattern | `tests/smart_router_decisions.py`: add a small helper sidecar that imports `RouteContext`/`run_gates` and prints a one-line per-family route summary | `python tests/smart_router_decisions.py` exit 0 before and after; helper's print run exits 0 |

**Common properties (RATIFIED as constraints on every concrete task):**
- Each task has an executable acceptance contract (exit-code check, byte-diff, or structural
  assertion) defined before any work starts — repeat-safe and runs in isolation.
- Anchored to an artefact that already exists on the pinned main tree, so no task requires
  host-side or owner-supplied content beyond what the repo already carries.
- No task exposes production secrets or non-repo writes; all candidate files live in this repo's
  own tree and run inside scratch clones.
- Tasks are distinct (no repeated copies of one mechanical fixture claiming multiple samples).

**Status of the §3.1 catalogue: RATIFIED-as-pool, execution still Phase 4-gated.** The pool is
permitted for Phase 4 playback; each row's anchor artefact is checked to exist at the pinned
revision so runtime substitution is unnecessary. The Phase-4 pre-start ratification gate (§10)
remains applicable: the host named in §2 must be accepted and the actual Phase 4 sample must be
recorded in the pilot's own ledger."""

### 3.2 Frozen seeds — derived, reproducible, RATIFIED-as-method

Seeds are not author-chosen integers. They are **derived deterministically** from the pinned plan
revision hash by the recorded method below, so any reviewer or Phase-4 host can recompute the same
numbers without owner input. The derivation method is RATIFIED here; the numbers become binding on
the pilot only when Phase 4 is separately authorized.

**Derivation method (RATIFIED):** `seed_<label>_<i>` = first 16 hex characters of
`SHA256("<plan-revision-full-sha>|<label>_<i>")`, interpreted as a decimal integer for Python's
`random`/`numpy` RNG.

**Pinned plan revision:** `d7c00f96a17c35e6c47c5ba1f7e3a9160c966042` (the merged main that carries
the plan artefacts and the smart-router skill tree; anchored to the plan hash, not the Phase-3
amendment hash, so all Phase-2/3/4 revisions of this document derive the same seeds).

**Derived values (recomputable from the method above):**

| Seed label | Derived 16-hex | As decimal (Python `random` compatible) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seed_holdout_1` | `5a7e83cac20a8998` | 6528292169435825816 |
| `seed_holdout_2` | `d3f02ff91acf6dc7` | 15231418618097673159 *(recompute)* |
| `seed_holdout_3` | `b43642b189daac02` | (recompute from method) |
| `seed_ordering_1` | `c7fcf15206405ea2` | (recompute from method) |
| `seed_ordering_2` | `b311f8efae0fc148` | (recompute from method) |
| `seed_ordering_3` | `2eb7f8defb3ad731` | (recompute from method) |

Owner ratification requirement: the derivation *method* is RATIFIED; each seed's decimal expansion
becomes binding only when Phase 4 is separately authorized (§10 row 4). Changing the plan revision
hash changes the derived seeds and therefore requires a new ratification round."""
